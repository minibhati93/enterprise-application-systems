# Frontend System Notes

This repository is a collection of notes, reflections, and decision records
from my work and exploration as a frontend engineer working on large UI systems.

This is **not a tutorial repository**.

The goal here is to document:
- How frontend systems behave as they scale
- Why certain architectural decisions help or hurt over time
- Trade-offs encountered in real-world UI development
- Patterns I’ve changed my mind about

## What you’ll find here
- Decision logs from frontend projects
- Notes on frontend architecture and system boundaries
- Observations from maintaining long-lived Angular applications
- Reflections on developer experience, performance, and maintainability

Some notes may feel incomplete or opinionated — that’s intentional.
They represent **thinking in progress**, not polished conclusions.

## Topics explored
- Frontend architecture at scale
- State management trade-offs
- Component boundaries and abstractions
- UI systems and team scalability
- Technical debt in frontend applications

## Why this repo exists
As engineers grow more senior, the hardest problems stop being about syntax.
They become about **judgment, constraints, and trade-offs**.

This repository exists to practice and document that kind of thinking.
