# Enterprise Application Systems

This repository documents how large-scale enterprise applications
are designed, built, and evolved over time.

The focus here is not on any single framework or technology,
but on **system-level decisions and trade-offs** across the application stack.

This is a thinking and learning repository — not a reference guide.

## Why this repository exists

Enterprise applications are shaped less by technology
and more by constraints:

- Team size and ownership
- Longevity of the system
- Business priorities
- Performance and reliability expectations

This repository exists to explore how those constraints influence:

- Framework selection
- Application structure
- State management
- Integration patterns
- Developer experience

---

## What this repository covers

Topics explored here span the full lifecycle of an enterprise application:

- Choosing frontend frameworks and platforms
- Monolith vs microfrontend trade-offs
- State management strategies
- API design and integration (REST, GraphQL)
- Performance and scalability decisions
- Accessibility and internationalization
- Security and reliability considerations
- Tooling, workflows, and governance

Each topic focuses on **why decisions were made**, not just how they were implemented.

## How to read this repository

Notes are written as:

- Decision explorations
- Trade-off analyses
- System behavior observations

Some topics may overlap or evolve over time.
That’s intentional — real systems are rarely static.

---

## Relationship to published writing

Some of the ideas and explorations in this repository
eventually become blog posts.

Published articles are curated snapshots.
This repository remains the source of truth.

---

## Intended audience

This repository is written for:

- Senior and principal engineers
- Engineers working on enterprise-scale systems
- Anyone interested in system-level thinking

It is not optimized for beginners.

## Status

This repository evolves slowly.
Notes may be incomplete, opinionated, or revised.
That’s part of the process.
